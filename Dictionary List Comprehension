'''
Remember that zip() combines two lists into a zipped list of pairs. This list comprehension:

Takes a pair from the zipped list of pairs from names and heights
Names the elements in the pair key (the one originally from the names list) and value (the one originally from the heights list)
Creates a key : value item in the students dictionary
Repeats steps 1-3 for the entire list of pairs
